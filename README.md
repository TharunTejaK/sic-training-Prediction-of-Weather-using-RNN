# 🌦️ Prediction of Weather using RNN

This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model to predict weather conditions using historical weather data.  
It demonstrates how sequence models can capture temporal dependencies in time-series data for forecasting tasks.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal**: Predict future weather parameters using past records.  
- **Approach**: Use **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)** for sequence modeling.  
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn.  
- **Dataset**: Historical weather dataset (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.).

## ⚙️ Features
- Preprocessing and cleaning of raw weather data.  
- Implementation of RNN model architecture.  
- Model training and evaluation.  
- Visualization of predictions vs actual results.
